#  Objective-C Labs

## Overview
This is a repository for my answers for the labs in the objective-c class.

## What I could learn
Through the labs, I could learn the basic syntax of objective-c enough to read and write simple programs. The main objective from lab9 to lab12 was learning the delegation pattern. I already knew the design pattern, however, my understanding of the delegation went deeper thanks to these labs.

Overall, these assignments were very helpful for me to understand what's behind the Swift language.
